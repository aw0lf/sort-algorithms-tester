# Sort Algorithms Tester
Application that allows you to test the speed of sorting algorithms. 
 - Generate ten sets of numbers (10, 20, 30, 50, 75, 100, 200, 300, 400 and 500 elements).
 - Generate three versions: optimistic  (partly sorted) random (random numbers) and pessimistic (sorted backwards).
 - Calculate  five times the execution time of the algorithm for individual data sets.
 - Displays the results for each test with the average.
